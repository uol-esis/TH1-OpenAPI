#pivotMatrixStructure:
description: |
  This converter remove certain columns from a pivot matrix based on their indices.

  In addition, the converter supports the definition of block indices to separate logical data blocks 
  within the matrix. This is particularly helpful if several pivot structures 
  occur one after the other in a table.

  The 'keysToCarryForward' field can be used to specify certain column names whose 
  values are to be carried forward automatically from previous rows when empty cells occur 
  (so-called "carry forward").
  
  Notes:
  - ‘columnIndex’ is a list of the column indices to be removed. An invalid index leads to an error.
  - ‘blockIndices’ defines the rows at which new data blocks start (default: [0]).
  - 'keysToCarryForward' contains the column names where missing values are to be filled in.

  The converterType MUST be PIVOT_MATRIX.
